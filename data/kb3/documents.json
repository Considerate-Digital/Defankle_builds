The response highlights the significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, treatment, and research between men and women.\n## Key Statistics and Facts\n- Cardiovascular disease is the world's biggest killer for both women and men\n- It causes 35% of deaths in women worldwide and 26% of deaths in women in the UK\n- Women comprise about 3.6 million of the 7.6 million people in the UK living with CVD\n- Coronary heart disease kills twice as many women as breast cancer in the UK\n## Main Issues Identified\n1. **Awareness Gap**: Women are under-aware of their cardiovascular risk\n2. **Diagnostic Disparities**: Women are 50% more likely to receive the wrong initial diagnosis for heart attacks\n3. **Treatment Inequalities**: Women receive fewer guideline-recommended therapies than men\n4. **Research Representation**: Women are underrepresented in cardiovascular research\n## Sex-Specific Risk Factors\n- Notable sex differences exist across all major cardiovascular risk factors:\n  - Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n  - Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)\n  - Diabetes (44% greater risk of coronary heart disease in women with diabetes than men)\n  - Obesity and weight issues\n- Pregnancy-related conditions increase later CVD risk:\n  - Pre-eclampsia\n  - Gestational diabetes\n  - Preterm delivery\n  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy\n## CVD Conditions With Higher Prevalence in Women\n- Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA)\n- Ischemia with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (INOCA)\n- Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)\n- Takotsubo Syndrome\n## Research and Workforce Issues\n- Only 38.2% of cardiovascular clinical trial participants are women\n- Women are underrepresented in the research and clinical workforce\n- Only 13% of cardiology consultants in the UK are women\n- Female researchers experience higher rates of harassment and bullying\n## Recommendations\n1. Develop a comprehensive Women's Health Strategy with near and long-term interventions\n2. Improve cardiovascular risk assessments in women, including better integration of pregnancy-related risk factors\n3. Target research toward CVD conditions that disproportionately affect women\n4. Increase women's participation in clinical trials\n5. Address gender inequalities in the cardiovascular research and clinical workforce\n6. Enhance awareness of CVD in women among both healthcare professionals and the public\nThe BHF emphasizes that a holistic approach to women's health is needed that goes beyond reproductive health and considers cardiovascular health across a woman's entire lifespan.",
